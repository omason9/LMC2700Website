                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="para">Hi, my name is Owen Mason and I created this page to share a little bit about myself with those who might be interested. I am a member of the Georgia Tech class of 2025 and am currently in my second year. As my major I study computational media, which blends elements of computer science and creative design. In the computational media program at Georgia Tech students choose two “threads” to focus their study on. One of mine is Intelligence, the computer science thread specific to studying cognitive models and artificial intelligence. My other thread is the Games thread focused on digital art and game design. I have been taking classes related to these topics for a few semesters now and I am very passionate about the use of computers and digital media as an outlet for creativity, work, entertainment and everything in-between.

                <p class="para">As for more about myself, I’m from New Jersey and can still call it home since I frequently visit over breaks. It’s there that I went to highschool at the Academy for Information Technology which is where I found my passion for computer science. When I applied to Georgia Tech however, I applied as a computational media major because I’ve always been a huge nerd who passed time by fantasizing about my own ideas for games, stories, characters and worlds. Computational Media is the perfect outlet for both my love of the practical application of computer science and my own personal creative aspirations. If you’re looking for someone with practical programming experience and an active imagination, I’m your guy.</p>
