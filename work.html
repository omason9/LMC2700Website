                    <p class="para">Study Smarter is an online global study aide website originating from Germany that provides guides, material and practice tests for students looking to study for specific subjects and standardized tests. Over the summer of 2022 I worked as a content creation intern on the ACT Science team. In this role I created flashcards and practice exam questions for the ACT Science section by reviewing ACT testing standards and creating novel material based on their model.</p>

                    <p class="para">Code Ninjas is a growing franchise found across the United States, Canada and the UK. It is comprised of individual locations which provide a place for young kids to go afterschool to be introduced to programming and learn new skills as they progress through the program. During Highschool I worked for several years as an instructor or "Code Sensei" at the location in my hometown. As a Code Sensei I learned the ins and outs of several programming langauges, which I needed to know well enough to be able to explain to young students learning these langauges for the first time.</p>

The summer of my highschool senior year I participated in this program, learning how DNA is read and decoded as well as helping decode multiple DNA sequences for the aquatic plant Duckweed. Following that summer I served as a Teaching Assistant for my senior year Computational Biology course.</p>
